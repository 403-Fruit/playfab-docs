Our Objective C SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization. This SDK allows you to build native iOS apps in Object-C and access the PlayFab service.

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](https://api.playfab.com/sdks/sdk-generator). We generally build SDKs weekly to keep up-to-date with the latest API changes.
