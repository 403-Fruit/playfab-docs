# Cross-Platform C++

![Cross-Platform C++](./media/cpp1.png)

Our C++ SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs weekly to keep up-to-date with the latest API changes.
