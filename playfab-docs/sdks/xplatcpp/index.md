# Cross-Platform C++

![Cross-Platform C++](./media/cpp1.png)

Our Cross-Platform C++ SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

It currently supports the following platforms:

- [Windows (Win32) x64](quickstart-windows.md)
- [Xbox One](quickstart-xbox.md)
- [Linux](quickstart-linux.md)

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs weekly to keep up-to-date with the latest API changes.
