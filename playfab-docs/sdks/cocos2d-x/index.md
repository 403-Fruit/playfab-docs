# Cocos2D-x (C++)

![Cocos2D-x (C++)](./media/cocos2dx1.png)

Our Cocos2d-x SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests and JSON serialization.

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs weekly to remain current with the latest API changes.

> The cocos sdk has not yet been fully tested across all Cocos platforms. However, this list is improving over time.
