# PlayFab Release Notes 2019

## 191015

Date: 2019-10-15

### API Changes:

 - Minor bug fixes in the XplatCppSdk- PlayFab enums should now be enum classes, therefore strict typing will start to be enforced on PlayFab enums (see opensource cppCoreGuidelines on enum classes)
 - Profiles now have ExperimentVariants (PlayerProfiles and ProfilesAPI with updates to Admin and Server API's)
 - Updating Client error messages for AccountNotFound
 - Events API added clarifying descriptions to what namespaces are allowed for custom PlayStream events
 - MultiplayerAPI added Aliases with CreateBuildAlias, DeleteBuildAlias, GetBuildAlias, ListBuildAliases, UpdateBuildAlias
 
### UnrealSDK specific changes:

Verified working on 4.21, 4.22, 4.23

### UnitySDK specific changes:

Verified working on Unity: 5.6.Latest, and all versions from 2017.1.Latest to 2019.2.Latest
