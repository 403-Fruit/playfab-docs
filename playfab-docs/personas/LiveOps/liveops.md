# Getting started with LiveOps

We believe that a successful **LiveOps** strategy is the single, most important contributor to a game’s ability to connect with and grow a community. That’s why PlayFab was built from the ground up -  to support great **LiveOps** for your game.

This document will introduce you to the **LiveOps** capabilities of PlayFab, and help you discover more resources for **LiveOps** design and implementation.

## Create a PlayFab Account

Before you can call any PlayFab **API**, you must have a [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). If you already have a PlayFab account, you can skip this step.

Once you have a PlayFab account, navigate to the PlayFab home page, [https://playfab.com](https://playfab.com), and log in.

Since PlayFab does not know the name of your game studio, or the title of your game, initial values for these fields are assigned.

**Unnamed Studio** is the default name of your game studio, and **Unnamed Title** is the default **Title** of your game, as shown in the following screenshot. You can rename these at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Title ID** is unique to your game, which we call a title. You will use this value when you make PlayFab **API** calls (your **Title ID** will *not* be **BCFE**).

Your first title is auto-generated by us. If you need a new title later, you can create additional titles by selecting **Create a new game** (but don't do this yet).

The current **Title** and **User** can be found in the top right. An **Admin** menu appears when the **User** is selected.

## Open the Game Manager for your title

Before installing your **SDK**, select any title, and the Game Manager opens it. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the various sections in the Game Manager dashboard.

For a more detailed overview, visit the [Game Manager quickstart](../../features/config/gamemanager/quickstart.md).

The PlayFab Game Manager allows you to do whatever you need to with your game title. Once you have a grasp of the aspects of the Game Manager, install the **SDK** so you can start using **APIs**.

## Exploring LiveOps

**LiveOps** refers to an approach to game design and development that centers around the game after launch, and specifically player engagement and retention. **LiveOps** processes emphasis experimentation, real-time data collection and analysis, and iteration.

If you want to learn more about **LiveOps** in general, and how its  approach is applied to games at every phase of development, check out these resources:

## Doing LiveOps with PlayFab

PlayFab offer a variety of tools to empower you to run your **LiveOps** strategy. PlayFab Game Manager is your portal to access the tools and abilities described below. Game Manager provides a web-based interface from which **LiveOps** can be managed and deployed.

Most **LiveOps** functions can be created, managed, and deployed entirely from the Game Manager, and many can also be updated easily in bulk through **JSON** file uploads.

- **Player Segments** - PlayFab can automatically sort your players into cohorts, that can then be acted upon through **Cloudscript**, A/B testing, or rules. PlayFab comes with several of the most common segments already set up - but you can also make your own segments using player login data, or groups defined by in-game behavior.
- **Economy** - Manage your game’s monetization across all platforms through configurable stores, currencies, and pricing. Also, in-game economy can be managed through PlayFab, allowing real time changes to item catalogs, availability, pricing, and drop tables.
- **Leaderboards** – Create leaderboards to track any aspect of your game, and manage reset frequency and aggregation methods.
- **Content Configuration** – PlayFab allows for robust content management in real time, through key value pair definitions, in-game messaging, and email templates.
- **Automation** – Store and run scripts in the cloud with **CloudScript**, enabling everything from triggered events to highly customized data tracking.
- **A/B Testing** – Create, run, and report on A/B testing using PlayFab player segments.
- **Rules and Scheduled Tasks** – Set up rules and scheduled tasks based on **PlayStream** events or **CloudScripts**.
