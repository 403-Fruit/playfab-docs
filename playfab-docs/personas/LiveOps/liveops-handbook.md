## The PlayFab LiveOps Handbook

At PlayFab, we believe that LiveOps techniques are the single most important reason why great games connect with players and earn money from them effectively over the long haul.

This guide is for anyone interested in learning more about LiveOps, whether you’re already a practitioner but want to brush up on some aspects that you’re less familiar with, or you’re an expert. We hope you find the guide useful.

This LiveOps guide has two sections:

- [Introduction to LiveOps](intro-liveops.md). If you’re new to LiveOps - or want help convincing your executive producer about why you should be investing in LiveOps - this is a good place to start.
- [LiveOps Techniques](liveops-techniques.md). Here’s where you’ll find an exhaustive summary, with deep-dives into particular techniques.
