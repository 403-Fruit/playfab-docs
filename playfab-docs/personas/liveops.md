# Getting started for LiveOps

At PlayFab, we believe that LiveOps techniques are the single most important reason why great games connect with players over the long haul, and an effective LiveOps strategy can make the difference between success and failure for a modern game. LiveOps - the practice of making smart, data-driven and frequent changes to a game  after its launch to keep players engaged - has transformed the way that games are developed and managed.

## The impact of LiveOps

Successful free-to-play (F2P) and traditional AAA game studios today recognize and embrace the idea that games have evolved into services that evolve and grow over time with new content, live events, and frequent updates. While games must still aim to provide fun and engaging experiences, the bar has been raised - to be successful over the long term, games need to also understand and segment their players, develop deep relationships, and understand and meet the needs of multiple player segments. This requires the ability to track and understand the data that players generate in your game - and to react in real-time, which in turn requires that your game run on services.

Collectively, these activities have come to be called “LiveOps”, and they are most important for the rapidly growing market of F2P games, where games are monetized through in-game purchases and advertisements as opposed to one-time up-front payments. Zynga was one of the first US companies to adopt LiveOps techniques.

## Implications of LiveOps

Planning for a LiveOps model has several important ramifications for your studio. With LiveOps, you can:

- Make changes to your game quickly, which provides a fast and clean way to address unforeseen problems that crop up after launch. 

- Segment players and make targeted communications or offers appropriate for each segment to stimulate engagement and boost monetization.

- Run special in-game events to keep a game from getting stale, or attract players to come back and re-engage - often with dramatic impact.

- Collect and analyze game data to provide insight into how to tune and improve your game. Viewing performance in real-time can identify issues like a new update causing a spike in errors, or a mis-configuration causing an exploit that might permanently ruin your game’s economy if not quickly rolled back.

## Conclusion

The LiveOps approach is clearly gaining traction, and influencing how titles from F2P casual games to AAA titles build and run their games. Using LiveOps, games are launching faster, and are leveraging the flexibility of being run on services; they're using the data created by players to add new content and updates to the game and respond to issues in near real-time. This has had a very real impact on the 
development cycle, allowing teams to release much more frequently with targeted updates to their game clients.
