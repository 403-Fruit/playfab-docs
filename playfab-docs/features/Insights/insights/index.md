# PlayFab Insights

> [!NOTE]
> The PlayFab Explorer feature is in public preview. We anticipate ongoing changes to it as we continue gathering feedback and optimizing for customer use.

## What is PlayFab Insights?
PlayFab Insights is a completely managed data environment, giving you instant access to your game's data without the need for additional engineering. Unlike other hosted data solutions Insights requires no setup, no GDPR work, no extra engineering, simply use PlayFab services and your data is available.

## Key Features
### Automatic Ingestion
PlayFab services automatically fire Playstream events. Any events fired by PlayFab services or created through our SDK are automatically routed to your Insights cluster. There is no need to worry about defining schema or DDL from automatic events. However, the option for sending your own custom events [is available]('https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/analytics/metrics/playstream-events#custom-event-overview').
