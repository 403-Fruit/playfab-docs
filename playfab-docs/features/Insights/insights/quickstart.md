# Getting Started with PlayFab Insights
PlayFab Insights is available to all studios right out of the box. The only thing needed to get started is some data. Implement any PlayFab service and you will get playstream events automatically sent to your *Insights* or you [can send telemetry directly using PlayFab API calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/playfab/events/playstream-events?view=playfab-rest). Once you have some data checkout [Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/insights/explorer/quickstart) and the [Insights Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/insights/insights).
