# Items quickstart

In this quickstart tutorial, you will:

- Set up a virtual currency for your game. 
- Add an item to your in-game catalog. 
- Purchase an item in-game using virtual currency. 
- Set up a Virtual Currency for your game. 

PlayFab supports a robust game economy with multiple currencies and items. 

To access these features:

1. Go to economy and select currencies 
2. Click new currency and change these fields: 
    Currency code (2 uppercase characters): "GD"
    Display name: "Gold" 
    Click Save currency 
 
Now you can give players virtual currency directly. Since it can be dangerous to give clients the ability to call AddUserVirtualCurrency, let's add money using the Game Manager:

1. Go to the player's virtual currency tab 
2. Click on the "GD" currency 
3. Change the amount to 100 
4. Click save virtual currency. 

Now the player has 100 gold. What can you do with it? Buy an item!

## Adding an item to your in-game catalog

No sense having money if you can't spend it. Let's create a catalog, which is a collection of items. You can create catalogs that correspond to the platforms on which you're releasing your game, or major version numbers, whatever you like.
 
TIP: We don't recommend creating multiple catalogs to differentiate types of items, as you can filter items effectively using classes, tags, and stores.

To make a catalog with an item:

1. Go to economy and select catalogs. 
2. Create a new catalog named "main." An item with the ID of "One" has been added automatically.
3. Click on One and change these fields: 
    Item ID: "apple" 
    Display name: "Perfectly normal apple." At the bottom of the form is the Prices section, where you define how much an item costs in your game's virtual currency.
4. Set the apple's price in gold ("GD") to 5.
5. Click save item.
 
## Purchase an item using virtual currency

Let's get the catalog and attempt to make a purchase.

1. In your game, call GetCatalogItems:
    CatalogVersion: "main"
2. Verify that you see an "apple" with a "GO" price of 5.
3. Call PurchaseItem to buy the apple.
    CatalogVersion: "main" 
    ItemId: "apple" 
    VirtualCurrency: "GO" 
    Price: 5 
4. Last, call GetUserInventory and take a look at the player inventory. You should see an apple! 
   You can also check the player's PlayStream tab, and you should have seen a "Player vc item purchased." event. That player's Inventory tab will also show the apple. You can also revoke the item or grant yourself more apples on the Inventory tab. If you check the playerâ€™s virtual currency, they should only have 95 gold left.
