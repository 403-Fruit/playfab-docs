# Metrics and Terminology

## Engagement Metrics

| Metric                  | Definition                                                                                             |
| :-----------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Usage**               | **API Usage** statistics are summarized by counts of **total calls**, **total successful calls**, and **total errors**.    |
| **DAU**                     | **Daily Active Users** gives you the count of unique **Players** who logged in on a given day, from 12AM to 11PM UTC.   |
| **Installs**                | The count of installations on new devices, measured by the number of unique device **IDs**. This number may include both new and returning **Players**.        |
| **Logins**                  | The count of **Player Login Events**. The **Unique Logins** counts the number of **Unique Players**. The **Total Logins** counts *all* **Login Events**, which can be used to track number of sessions played. **Average Logins per User** tracks the average number of **Login Events** per active **Player**.  Note: To obtain an accurate distribution of session counts, we recommend logging in the **Player** upon each session start, even if the old **Login Ticket** is still valid.   |
| **MAU**                     | **Monthly Active Users**. In **Rolling Thirty Day Totals Report**, **MAU** refers to the count of unique **Players** who logged in during the span of last 30 days. In **Monthly Totals Report**, **MAU** is calculated per month, based on the first and last days of a given month.             |
| **New Users**               | The count of **Players** who logged in for the first time, thus creating new **Player Profiles**.              |
| **Retention**               | The percentage of **Players** who logged in again exactly **N** days after a reference date, marked as **Day 0**. The **Thirty Day New User Retention Report** considers new **Users** who joined the game within the span of last 30 days. The **Thirty Day Retention Report** includes both new and returning **Users** who logged into the game within the span of last 30 days.   |

## Revenue Metrics

| Metric                  | Definition                                                                                             |
| :-----------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARPDAU**                  | **Average Revenue Per Daily Active User** in USD.
| **ARPPU**                   | **Average Revenue Per Paying User** within a specified time period (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly) in USD.
| **ARPU**                    | **Average Revenue Per active User** within a specified time period (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly) in USD.
| **Average Purchase Price**  | The average transaction amount in USD (= **Revenue/Purchases**).
| **Conversion**              | The percentage of **Players** who become paying users. **Thirty Day New User Conversion Report** tracks purchases made by new user cohorts over a 30-day period. Unlike **Retention Reports**, the **Conversion Report** tracks a cumulative total of **Players** who converted within a given time span.
| **Purchases**               | The count of transactions.
| **Top Items**               | The top 100 items which generated the most revenue in your game within a specified report period.
| **Top Spenders**            | The top 100 **Players** who spent the most money in your game within a specified report period.
| **Transaction Revenue**     | The sum of **Transaction** amounts in USD. **Transactions** made in other currencies are converted into USD, based on daily exchange rates.
| **Unique Paying Users**     | The count of **Unique Players** who spent money in your game.

## Terminology

| Metric               | Definition                                                                                             |
| :--------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cohort**               | A **Group** of **Players** who joined or played the game on a given day, marked as Day 0.
| **Event**                | **Events** mark the transition between important states in your game, such as a **Player** logging in, making a purchase, leveling up, or dying. A **Data Event** is a data structure that captures information about the **Event**. **PlayFab** uses **JSON** to represent **Data Events**. **Standard Events** are generated automatically during use of **PlayFab** services; games can generate **Custom Events** to track other important game-specific **Events**. All **Data Events** can be saved, aggregated, reacted to, and analyzed via **PlayFabâ€™s** real-time data pipeline, known as **PlayStream**.
| **Platform**             | **PlayFab** tracks four different types of **Platforms**: **OS** (**iOS**, **Android**), **Device Type** (**iPhone**, **iPad**, **Samsung Android**, **PC**, **Xbox**, etc.), **Account Type** (**Steam**, **Facebook**, **Kongregate**, **Custom**, etc.), and **Payment Type** (**iTunes**, **Google Play**, **Steam**, **Facebook**, **Xsolla**, etc.).
| **Segment**              | A **Group** of **Players** who share similar properties, e.g., geography, demographics, platform, purchase patterns, etc. In addition to **Standard Segments**, users can define **Custom Segments**. Note that **Segment** definitions are limited to properties in the entity profile.
| **Timestamp** (**TS**)       | All **PlayFab** real-time analytics and reports are based on **Coordinated Universal Time** (**UTC**).
