App Center provides tools to help you build, test, deploy and monitor mobile and pc apps. It is especially good at detecting when your app has crashed and saving that information to help you fix it quickly. When you link your App Center titles to a PlayFab title, you will be able to see crash data in the diagnostics tab in Game Manager.

Crash reporting is a critical part of developing quality games. This diagnostics integration with App Center will aid you in mitigating players that are having a bad experience in your game. Currently, you will have the ability to see title level diagnostics, including limited stacktrace and deep linking into App Center to further explore issues so you can resolve them.

Coming soon, will be per player crash reporting and PlayStream events when a player reports a crash. This means for the first time ever you can, in real-time, react to a player experiencing problems in your app. 

You will be able to use crash data that is impacting your players to segment them, create targeted messaging, extend promotional offers, grant virtual currency and more. This will help you mitigate a bad experience in your game.

To get started follow our [QuickStart Guide](quickstart.md)

You will need to create an App Center account and then integrate their SDK into your game. You can get an [App Center account for free here](https://appcenter.ms/create-account?referrer=playfab).
