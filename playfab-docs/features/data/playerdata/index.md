# Player Data

Store player information and game state in the cloud so data is never lost. This allows a player to share across multiple devices and your multiple games.

There are two models for storing player data:

- [Entity](../entities/index.md) data model allows you to store data in objects and files across Players, Characters, and Groups.
- [UserData](quickstart.md) allows you to store name/value pair data for players.

It is recommended that all new titles utilize [Entity objects](entity-objects.md) as that will give the most flexibility and performance for your game.
