# Player Segments

Players can be collected together into a segment, with the idea that all players in the segment meet certain conditions (filters). Once the segment is defined, you can monitor the total number of players in the segment and run custom actions on those players automatically or manually.

## Access Players Segments

To access Player Segments, navigate to "Players" using the sidebar panel **(1)**. Then select the "Segments" tab **(2)**.

For more information about defining segments, and the filtering criteria, see our tutorial on [Player Segment configuration](player-segment-configuration.md).

For more information about executing custom code for all players in a segment (once, or on a regular schedule), see our tutorial on [Bulk Actions for an Entire Player Segment](../../automation/actions-rules/bulk-actions-for-an-entire-player-segment).
