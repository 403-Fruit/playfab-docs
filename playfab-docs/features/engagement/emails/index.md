# Email Messaging

With email messaging, you can send customized emails to players on a prearranged schedule, triggered by a PlayStream event rule, or by calling an API. The content of the emails is fully customizable, with HTML templates which can include player profile properties. The emails are sent from your own email server, so details such as the “from” and “reply-to” fields are consistent with your brand.

Using email messaging, you can send an email to verify a user’s email address, reset their password, target a segment of lapsed players with a link to redeem a gift, or notify active players of an upcoming special event. These are just a few examples of addressing customer requests or stimulating player engagement.
