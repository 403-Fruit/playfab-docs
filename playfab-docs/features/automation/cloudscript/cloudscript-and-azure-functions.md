# CloudScript integration with Azure Functions

At GDC 2019, we shared our plans to integrate the power and ease of [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/) with PlayFab CloudScript's flexible configuration capabilities. This allows us to address several big customer requests:

* Support for C#, JavaScript, and other additional languages.
* Seamless switching from local to remote debugging.
* Easy deployment through GitHub, Azure DevOps, and more.

While we're not yet in public preview, we are looking for a handful of partners for early access to our beta SDK. Reach out to [HelloPlayFab@microsoft.com](mailto:HelloPlayFab@microsoft.com) to be kept in the loop!
