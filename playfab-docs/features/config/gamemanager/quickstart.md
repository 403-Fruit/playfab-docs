# Game Manager quickstart

## Let's begin with the basics: Your Developer Account

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must [have a PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). If you already *have* a PlayFab account, you can skip this step.

![PlayFab - Create your account](media/tutorials/playfab-create-account.png)

Once you have a PlayFab account, navigate to the **PlayFab** home page, [https://playfab.com](https://playfab.com), and log in.

Since PlayFab does not know the name of your game studio or the title of your game, initial values for these fields are assigned. 

- **Unnamed Studio** is the default name of your game studio.

- **Unnamed Title** is the default title of your game, as shown in the following example. You can rename these at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> The Title ID is unique value to your game, which we call a **Title**. You will use this value when you make PlayFab API calls (your **Title ID** will not be **BCFE**).

![PlayFab - Create a new game](media/tutorials/playfab-create-new-game.png)

Your first title is auto-generated by us. If you need a new title later, you can create additional titles by selecting **Create a new game** (but don't do this quite yet, please).

The current **Title** and **User** can be found in the top right of your screen. An **Admin** menu will appear when the **User** is selected (please refer to the example provided below).

![PlayFab - Unicorn Battle - Admin Menu](media/tutorials/playfab-unicorn-battle-admin-menu.png)

## Game Manager Sections

Once you have an account, you can select a **Title** (either the one we created, or one of your own) to follow along. Each **Title** has its own **Game Manager**, which covers the following sections:

- **Dashboard** - An overview of the performance of your title.
- **Players** - **Settings** and **Data** pertaining to your individual players, including player segmentation.
- **Economy** - **Settings** and **Data** pertaining to virtual items, stores, currencies and **Loot** distribution, and coupons.
- **Leaderboards** - Configure leaderboard settings, and view current rankings.
- **Multiplayer** - Configure server hosting, and view match records.
- **Content** - Manage the content for your game - including news, remote configuration, and files.
- **Automation** - Configure the server-side logic for your game - including scriptings, rules, and tasks. Trigger actions based on the events from your title.
- **Analytics** - View reports and event data for your game, and configure how data is routed to other systems.
- **Add-ons** - This is the control center for managing partner integrations.
- **Settings** - Displays the **Settings** and **Data** pertaining to the selected title.
- **Admin** - Contains the **Billing** and **Audit** history.

### Settings

The **Credentials** tab provides basic information that you will use to configure your SDK.

![Game Manager - Settings - Credentials Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-settings-credentials-tab.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Never share your PlayFab API Secret Key with anyone; doing so may jeopardize the security of your **Title**.

Your Credentials include:

- **Game Title ID**: The unique identifier for your title in the PlayFab system.
- **PlayFab API Endpoint**: The unique base URI for your title. API calls to this endpoint are tracked in your title reports.
- **PlayFab API Secret Key**: The unique identifier for your game when making **Admin** and **Server API** calls. This key should *only* be shared with trusted members of your development team, since it enables API calls that can affect game data and player accounts.
- **Publisher ID**: The unique identifier for your studio.

### Dashboard
   
The Dashboard displays your basic game statistics and **Key Performance Indicators** (**KPI**s). In the top left, you will find filter controls that limit the information displayed:

- **4h**: Will load data generated within the last 4 hours
- **24h**: Will load data generated within the last 24 hours
- **3d**: Will load data generated within the last 3 days
- **7d**: Will load data generated within the last 7 days
- **mtd**: Will load data generated within the current month

You can see data for previous months in the [Reports Section](#reports).

> [!NOTE]
> In **Game Manager**, all times are displayed in local time.

![Game Manager - Dashboard](media/tutorials/game-manager-dashboard.png)

Monitor your **Title's KPIs** and watch your **PlayStream Events** in real time.

The dashboard has six sections. Left to right, top to bottom they are the following.

1. **LOGIN**: The number of logins recorded for the selected time-span.
2. **INSTALL**: The number of accounts created (**Players** logging in for the very first time) for the selected time-span.
3. **REVENUE**: The USD value of real money transactions processed for the selected time-span.
4. **MONTH OVERVIEW**: Useful **KPIs** pulled from the month-to-date data
    - **Revenue**: the USD value of real-money transactions processed
    - **DAU (Daily Active Users)**: the average number of unique **Players** logging in per day
    - **MAU (Monthly Active Users)**: the average number of unique **Players** logging in per month
5. **PLAYSTREAM DEBUGGER**: Will display **Title** events as they are generated in real time.
6. **VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS**: The number of **Virtual Currency** transactions recorded for the selected time span.

### 3. PlayStream

This section houses the control panel for everything that is **PlayStream**. Here you will find a graph of the **PlayStream** activity (filtered for the selected time-span).

The stream debugger (like in other sections) displays **Title Events** as they are generated in real time.

![Game Manager - PlayStream](media/tutorials/game-manager-playstream.png)

Use the sampling controls to gather more or less events per second.

**PlayStream** is our latest and greatest addition to the **PlayFab** platform. More information will be coming soon on what actions you can do with **PlayStream**.

### 4. Players

The **Players** tab presents you with a sorted list by most recent login. Selecting any of the records will take you to that **Player's** overview.

Using the **SEARCH** box, you can easily look for players by **ID**, **Username**, **Display Name**, or **Email**.

![Game Manager - Players Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-tab.png)

#### Player Overview

This detailed screen provides a wealth of insight into the **Player's** activity. The **Overview** sub-menu contains many links to other **Player**-centric information.

![Game Manager - Player - Overview](media/tutorials/game-manager-player-overview.png)

Tools your team can use to remedy defrauded **Players** and identify potential abusers.

![Game Manager - Players - Leaderboards](media/tutorials/game-manager-player-leaderboards.png)

Selecting a **Player Name** will take you to that **Player's** overview.

The **Leaderboards** reset frequency controls when one "season" begins and another ends. Our **Leaderboards** can optionally to reset themselves **hourly**, **daily**, **weekly** and monthly.

### 5. Economy

At the center of **PlayFab Economies** is the concept of **Catalogs**. 

**Catalogs** are a collection of **Items**, **Currencies**, **Stores**, and **Droptables**. This section provides all the tools needed to manage your game's virtual economy.

As an example, the following image shows **Unicorn Battle's** primary **Catalog**.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs.png)

- **Catalog Items** - An **Item** within the **Catalog**. **Items** can be of several different types.
- **Virtual Currencies** - Arbitrary trackers for the mediums that can be exchanged for **Catalog Items**.
- **Stores**- A subset of **Catalog Items** that can be set to prices that are different than those specified by the **Catalog**.
- **Drop Tables** - Control the **Item** distribution when **Players** open **Containers** and **Bundles**.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

Selecting any **Catalog Item** opens a detailed editor for the **Item** properties.

The following example shows the **Edit Currency** page for the **Unicorn Battle's VC** called **Hearts**. The settings show that it is being used as a "lives" mechanic that regenerates every hour.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

**Additional Information:**

### 6. Servers

**PlayFab** works with many architectures and game types. Whether you are looking to hosting multiplayer matches, or just need a secure environment that can reduce many common forms of hacking and abuse.

![Game Manager - Servers - CloudScript](media/tutorials/game-manager-servers-cloudscript.png)

**CloudScript** offers an excellent alternative when compared with the overhead of dedicated game servers.

The servers section of the **Game Manager** has two major roles:

1. The main interface for uploading **CloudScript** files.
2. A control panel for your hosted multiplayer servers.

**Additional Information:**

- [CloudScript quickstart](../../automation/cloudscript/quickstart.md)

### 7. Promotions

The **Promotions** section offers tools for engaging with your **Players**.

The following example shows the active news articles within **Unicorn Battle**.

### 8. Add-ons

We have many great vendors, and each one brings something unique to the table. We could tell you all about it here, but its better if you see it for yourself.

  ![Game Manager - Add-ons - Partner Add-ons](media/tutorials/game-manager-add-ons-partner-add-ons.png)

Setup instructions for each **Add-on** may vary. Additional billing information may also be required.

- **Daily Overview Report**: Reports the daily **KPIs** for your **Title**.
- **Monthly Overview Report**: Reports the aggregated **KPIs** for the month.
- **Monthly Top Spender Report**: Reports the month's top paying **Players**.
