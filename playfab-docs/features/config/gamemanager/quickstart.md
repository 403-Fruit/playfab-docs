# Game Manager quickstart

This quickstart familiarizes you with the high-level aspects of the Game Manager. For more detailed information, select your specific topic of interest in the PlayFab documentation. By now, you should have created your PlayFab account, logged in, and viewed the Game Manager for your title, even if it's an empty title for now. The following provides more detail on each Game Manager area. Each time you perform an API call or task, view the results in the Game Manager in the appropriate area for that task.

## Let's begin with the basics: Your Developer Account

Before you can call any PlayFab **API**, you must [have a PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). If you already have a PlayFab account, you can skip this step.

![PlayFab - Create your account](media/tutorials/playfab-create-account.png)

Once you have a PlayFab account, navigate to the **PlayFab** home page, [https://playfab.com](https://playfab.com), and log in.

Since PlayFab does not know the name of your game studio or the title of your game, initial values for these fields are assigned.

 **Unnamed Studio** is the default name of your game studio, and **Unnamed Title** is the default **Title** of your game, as shown in the following screenshot. You can rename these at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Title ID** is unique to your game, which we call a **Title**.  You will use this value when you make PlayFab **API** calls (your **Title ID** will *not* be **BCFE**).

![PlayFab - Create a new game](media/tutorials/playfab-create-new-game.png)

Your first title is auto-generated by us.  If you need a new title later, you can create additional titles by selecting **Create a new game** (but don't do this yet).

The current **Title** and **User** can be found in the top right. An **Admin** menu appears when the **User** is selected.

![PlayFab - Unicorn Battle - Admin Menu](media/tutorials/playfab-unicorn-battle-admin-menu.png)

## Game Manager Sections

Now that you have an account, select a title (either the one we created or one of your own) to follow along. Within each title, the scope of a new Game Manager is distributed across the following major sections:

1. **Dashboard** - An overview of the performance of your title.
2. **Players** - Settings and data pertaining to your individual players, including player segmentation.
3. **Economy** - Settings and data pertaining to virtual items, stores, currencies and loot distribution. Also stores and coupons.
4. **Leaderboards** - Configure leaderboard settings, and view current rankings.
5. **Multiplayer** - Configure server hosting, and view match records.
6. **Content** - Manage content for your game, including news, remote configuration, and files.
7. **Automation** - Server-side logic for your game, including scriptings, rules, and tasks. Trigger actions based on events from your title.
8. **Analytics** - View reports and event data for your game, and configure how data is routed to other systems.
9. **Add-ons** - The control center for managing partner integrations.
10. **Settings** - Settings and data pertaining to the entire title.
11. **Admin** - Billing and audit history.

### 1. Settings

The **Credentials** tab provides basic information that you will use to configure your **SDK**.

![Game Manager - Settings - Credentials Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-settings-credentials-tab.png)

Never share your PlayFab **API** secret key with anyone; doing so may jeopardize your title's security.

- **Game Title ID**: The unique identifier for your title in the PlayFab system.
- **PlayFab API Endpoint**: The unique base **URI** for your title. **API** calls to this endpoint are tracked in your title's reports.
- **PlayFab API Secret Key**: The unique identifier for your game when making Admin and server **API** calls. This key should only be shared with trusted members of your development team, since it enables **API** calls that can affect game data and player accounts.
- **Publisher ID**: The unique identifier for your studio.

### 2. Dashboard

The **Dashboard** shows your gameâ€™s basic statistics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In the top left, you will find filter controls that limit the information displayed:

- *4h*: This will load data generated within the last 4 hours.
- *24h*: This will load data generated within the last 24 hours.
- *3d*: This will load data generated within the last 3 days.
- *7d*: This will load data generated within the last 7 days.
- *mtd*: This will load data generated within the current month.

You can see data for previous months in the [Reports Section](#9-reports).

> [!NOTE]
> In Game Manager, all times are displayed in local time.

![Game Manager - Dashboard](media/tutorials/game-manager-dashboard.png)

Monitor your title's KPIs and watch your **PlayStream** events in real time.

The dashboard has six sections. Left to right, top to bottom they are the following.

1. **LOGIN**: The number of logins recorded for the selected time span.
2. **INSTALL**: The number of accounts created (players logging in for the very first time) for the selected time span.
3. **REVENUE**: The USD value of real money transactions processed for the selected time span.
4. **MONTH OVERVIEW**: Useful KPIs pulled from the month-to-date data
    - **Revenue**: The USD value of real money transactions processed.
    - **DAU (Daily Active Users)**: The average number of unique players logging in per day.
    - **MAU (Monthly Active Users)**: the average number of unique players logging in per month.
5. **PLAYSTREAM DEBUGGER**: This will display title events as they are generated in real time.
6. **VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS**: The number of virtual currency transactions recorded for the selected time span.

### 3. PlayStream

This section houses the control panel for everything that is **PlayStream**. Here you will find a graph of the **PlayStream** activity (filtered for the selected time span). The stream debugger (like in other sections) displays title events as they are generated in real time.

![Game Manager - PlayStream](media/tutorials/game-manager-playstream.png)

Use the sampling controls to gather more or less events per second.

**PlayStream** is our latest and greatest addition to the PlayFab platform. More information will be coming soon on what actions you can do with **PlayStream**.

### 4. Players

The **Players** tab presents you with a sorted list by most recent login. Selecting any of the records will take you to that player's overview. Using the search box you can easily search for players by **ID**, **Username**, **Display Name**, or **Email**.

![Game Manager - Players Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-tab.png)

#### Player Overview

This detailed screen provides a wealth of insight into the players activity. The **Overview** sub-menu contains many links to other **Players**-centric information:

![Game Manager - Player - Overview](media/tutorials/game-manager-player-overview.png)

Tools your team can use to remedy defrauded players and identify potential abusers.

- **Overview**- View basic details and linked account status.
- **PlayStream**- View player generated events.
- **Logins**- View player login history.
- **Segments**- View which segments a player has entered.

#### Leaderboards

Leaderboards, the second tab, displays all the active leaderboards for your title. PlayFab leaderboards are driven by your player statistics. Selecting a statistic will display the corresponding leaders.

![Game Manager - Players - Leaderboards](media/tutorials/game-manager-player-leaderboards.png)

Selecting a **Player Name** will take you to that **Player** overview.

The leaderboard reset frequency controls when one "season" begins and another ends. Our leaderboards can optionally to reset themselves **hourly**, **daily**, **weekly** and **monthly**.

Selecting the orange **EDIT LEADERBOARD** button allows you to edit your leaderboard name, as well as the reset frequency.

### 5. Economy

At the center of PlayFab economies is the concept of catalogs.

Catalogs are a collection of items, currencies, stores, and droptables. This section provides all the tools needed to manage your game's virtual economy.

As an example, the following image shows **Unicorn Battle's** primary catalogs.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs.png)

- **Catalog Items** - An item within the catalog. Items can be of several different types.
- **Virtual Currencies** - Arbitrary trackers for the mediums that can be exchanged for catalog items.
- **Stores**- A subset of catalog items that can be set to prices that are different than those specified by the catalog.
- **Drop Tables** - Control the item distribution when players open containers and bundles.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

Selecting any catalog item opens a detailed editor for the item properties.

The following example shows the **Edit Currency** page for the **Unicorn Battle's VC** called **Hearts**. The settings show that it is being used as a "lives" mechanic that regenerates every hour.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

**Additional Information:**

- [Currencies Tutorial](../../commerce/economy/currencies.md)

### 6. Servers

PlayFab works with many architectures and game types. Whether you are looking to hosting multi-player matches or just need a secure environment that can reduce many common forms of hacking and abuse.

![Game Manager - Servers - CloudScript](media/tutorials/game-manager-servers-cloudscript.png)

**CloudScript** offers an excellent alternative when compared with the overhead of dedicated game servers.

The servers section of the Game Manager has two major roles:

1. The main interface for uploading **CloudScript** files.
2. A control panel for your hosted multiplayer servers.

**Additional information:**

- [CloudScript Quickstart](../../automation/cloudscript/quickstart.md)
- [Building Custom Game Servers Tutorial](../../multiplayer/servers/custom-game-servers.md)

### 7. Promotions

The promotions section offers tools for engaging with your players.

The following example shows the active **News** articles within **Unicorn Battle**.

![Game Manager - Promotions - Title News](media/tutorials/game-manager-promotions-title-news.png)

[Back to Game Manager Sections](#game-manager-sections)

### 8. Add-ons

We have many great vendors, and each one brings something unique to the table. We could tell you all about it here, but its better if you see it for yourself.

- To configure marketplace integrations for your title: Explore the **Add-ons** section of the Game Manager for details on the various add-ons.

  ![Game Manager - Add-ons - Partner Add-ons](media/tutorials/game-manager-add-ons-partner-add-ons.png)

Setup instructions for each add-on may vary. Additional billing information may also be required.

[Back to Game Manager Sections](#game-manager-sections)

### 9. Reports

PlayFab generates catalogs that capture daily and monthly activity. Currently, there are three reports available to all developers:

- **Daily Overview Report**: Reports the daily KPIs for your title.
- **Monthly Overview Report**: Reports the aggregated KPIs for the month.
- **Monthly Top Spender Report**: Reports the month's top paying player.

![Game Manager - Reports](media/tutorials/game-manager-reports.png)

## Settings actions
