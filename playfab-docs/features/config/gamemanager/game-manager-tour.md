# Game Manager Tour

## Let's begin with the basics: Your Developer Account

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must [have a PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). If you already have a PlayFab account, you can skip this step.

![PlayFab - Create your account](media/tutorials/playfab-create-account.png)

Once you have a PlayFab account, navigate to the PlayFab home page, [https://playfab.com](https://playfab.com), and log in.

Since PlayFab does not know the name of your game studio or the title of your game, initial values for these fields are assigned. **Unnamed Studio** is the default name of your game studio and **Unnamed Title** is the default title of your game, as shown in the following screenshot. You can rename these at any time.

Note the Title ID. This value is unique to your game, which we call a “Title”, and you will use this value when you make PlayFab API calls. (Your Title ID will not be BCFE)

![PlayFab - Create a new game](media/tutorials/playfab-create-new-game.png)

Your first title is auto-generated by us.  If you need a new title later, you can create additional titles by clicking "Create a new game" (Don't do this yet).

The current title and user can be found in the top right. An admin menu appears when the user is clicked.

![PlayFab - Unicorn Battle - Admin Menu](media/tutorials/playfab-unicorn-battle-admin-menu.png)

## Game Manager Sections

Now that you have an account, select a title (either the one we created or one of your own) to follow along. Within each title, the scope of a new Game Manager is distributed across the following major sections:

1. **Dashboard** - An overview of the performance of your title.
2. **Players** - Settings and Data pertaining to your individual players, including player segmentation.
3. **Economy** - Settings and Data pertaining to virtual items, stores, currencies and 'loot' distribution. Also stores and coupons.
4. **Leaderboards** - Configure leaderboard settings, and view current rankings.
5. **Multiplayer** - Configure server hosting, and view match records.
6. **Content** - Manage content for your game, including news, remote configuration, and files.
7. **Automation** - Server-side logic for your game, including scriptings, rules, and tasks. Trigger actions based on events from your title.
8. **Analytics** - View reports and event data for your game, and configure how data is routed to other systems.
9. **Add-ons** - The control center for managing partner integrations.
10. **Settings** - Settings and Data pertaining to the entire title.
11. **Admin** - Billing and audit history.

### 1. Settings

The credentials tab provides basic information that you will use to configure your SDK.

![Game Manager - Settings - Credentials Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-settings-credentials-tab.png)

Never share your PlayFab API Secret Key with anyone; doing so may jeopardize your title's security.

- **Game Title ID**: The unique identifier for your title in the PlayFab system.
- **PlayFab API Endpoint**: The unique base URI for your title. API calls to this endpoint are tracked in your title’s reports.
- **PlayFab API Secret Key**: The unique identifier for your game when making Admin and Server API calls. This key should only be shared with trusted members of your development team, since it enables API calls that can affect game data and player accounts.
- **Publisher ID**: The unique identifier for your studio.

### 2. Dashboard
   
The Dashboard shows your game’s basic statistics and key performance indicators (KPIs). In the top left, you will find filter controls that limit the information displayed:

- *4h*: will load data generated within the last 4 hours
- *24h*: will load data generated within the last 24 hours
- *3d*: will load data generated within the last 3 days
- *7d*: will load data generated within the last 7 days
- *mtd*: will load data generated within the current month

You can see data for previous months in the [Reports Section](#reports).

> [!NOTE]
> In Game Manager, all times are displayed in local time.

![Game Manager - Dashboard](media/tutorials/game-manager-dashboard.png)

Monitor your title's KPIs and watch your PlayStream events in real time.

The dashboard has six sections. Left to right, top to bottom they are the following.

1. **LOGIN**: The number of logins recorded for the selected time-span.
2. **INSTALL**: The number of accounts created (players logging in for the very first time) for the selected time-span.
3. **REVENUE**: The USD value of real-money transactions processed for the selected time-span.
4. **MONTH OVERVIEW**: Useful KPIs pulled from the month-to-date data
    - *Revenue*: the USD value of real-money transactions processed
    - *DAU (Daily Active Users)*: the average number of unique players logging in per day
    - *MAU (Monthly Active Users)*: the average number of unique players logging in per month
5. **PLAYSTREAM DEBUGGER**: Will display title events as they are generated in real-time.
6. **VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS**: The number of virtual currency transactions recorded for the selected time-span.

### 3. PlayStream

This section houses the control panel for everything that is PlayStream. Here you will find a graph of the PlayStream activity (filtered for the selected time-span). The stream debugger (like in other sections) displays title events as they are generated in real-time.

![Game Manager - PlayStream](media/tutorials/game-manager-playstream.png)

Use the sampling controls to gather more or less events per second.

PlayStream is our latest and greatest addition to the PlayFab platform. More information will be coming soon on what actions you can do with PlayStream.

### 4. Players

The "Players" tab presents you with a sorted list by most recent login. Clicking any of the records will take you to that player's overview. Using the search box you can easily search for players by ID, username, display name, or email.

![Game Manager - Players Tab](media/tutorials/game-manager-players-tab.png)

#### Player Overview

This detailed screen provides a wealth of insight into the player's activity. The Overview sub-menu contains many links to other player-centric information:

Tools your team can use to remedy defrauded players and identify potential abusers.

![Game Manager - Players - Leaderboards](media/tutorials/game-manager-player-leaderboards.png)

Clicking a player name will take you to that player's overview.

The leaderboard reset frequency controls when one "season" begins and another ends. Our leaderboards can optionally to reset themselves hourly, daily, weekly and monthly. Clicking the orange "EDIT LEADERBOARD" allows you to edit your leaderboard's name as well as the reset frequency.

### 5. Economy

At the center of PlayFab Economies is the concept of Catalogs. Catalogs are a collection of items, currencies, stores, and droptables. This section provides all the tools needed to manage your game's virtual economy.

As an example, the following image shows Unicorn Battle's primary catalog.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs.png)

- **Catalog Items** - An item within the catalog. Items can be of several different types.
- **Virtual Currencies** - Arbitrary trackers for the mediums that can be exchanged for Catalog Items.
- **Stores**- A subset of Catalog Items that can be set to prices that are different than those specified by the Catalog.
- **Drop Tables** - Control the item distribution when players open containers and bundles.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

Clicking on any Catalog Items opens a detailed editor for the item properties.

The following example shows the Edit Currency page for the Unicorn Battle's VC called "Hearts". The settings show that it is being used as a "lives" mechanic that regenerates every hour.

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs - Edit Container](media/tutorials/game-manager-economy-catalogs-edit-container.png)

### 6. Servers

PlayFab works with many architectures and game types. Whether you are looking to hosting multi-player matches or just need a secure environment that can reduce many common forms of hacking and abuse.

![Game Manager - Servers - CloudScript](media/tutorials/game-manager-servers-cloudscript.png)

Cloud Script offers an excellent alternative when compared with the overhead of dedicated game servers.

The servers section of the Game Manager has two major roles:

1. The main interface for uploading CloudScript files.
2. A control panel for your hosted multiplayer servers.

**Additional Information:**
