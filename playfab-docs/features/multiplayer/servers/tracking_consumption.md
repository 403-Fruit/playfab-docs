# Tracking title consumption of multiplayer servers

In the Multiplayer Server tab, there is a “Monitoring” section that you can use to track server consumption. For multiplayer-focused games, server spend can be significant and these tools help you monitor your estimated bill. 

The following time-series data is available to you via the monitoring experience: 
-	**Compute-hour estimates** are provided with 2-hour delay
-	**Network consumption estimates** are provided with a 24-hour delays 
Graph showing compute-hours (y-axis) over time (x-axis). Customer can breakdown by core type and change time range (from 12 months to 3-days).

The Monitoring experience allows you to view consumption in dollars, but this monetary value is an estimate using online pay-as-you-go pricing. 

## Download consumption data 
You can download a CSV for consumption graphs in the **Monitoring** section. This breakdown down consumption by individual build for deeper analysis.

Also in the Analytics -> Reports section, similar CSV content aggregating multiplayer server consumption over a rolling 30 day window is available each day. This CSV report breakdowns consumption by individual build, and uses your actual price sheet to provide monetary values.
