# Matchmaking with Unity quickstart

This quickstart guide walks you through the entire flow for integrating the matchmaking feature into your Unity game. Depending on your game design, consider the [single user](#Single-User-Ticket-Matchmaking) matchmaking section and the matchmaking for [groups of players](#Multiple-User-Ticket-Matchmaking) section. This guide assumes that you have already configured a matchmaking queue in Game Manager. 

This tutorial shows how to submit a ticket to a specific queue in order to find a game. A queue likely maps to a game mode or multiple game modes (ex.: a capture the flag mode and a king of the hill mode in the same queue). The matchmaking service handles finding a match amongst tickets in a queue. When a match is found, your title must handle connecting the players together for gameplay.

## Single User Ticket Matchmaking

If your game has a 1v1 game mode or supports a single user entering matchmaking by themselves, consider single user matchmaking.

### Create a matchmaking ticket

A user creates a matchmaking ticket using [CreateMatchmakingTicket](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.matchmaking.creatematchmakingticket). When ticket creation is successful, the service returns a `TicketId`.

 The ticket creation requires you to specify the `Creator` (the user's identity and attributes), `GiveUpAfterSeconds` (the time in seconds before the service gives up on matching the ticket), and the `QueueName` for which you are matchmaking into. The `Creator` field must contain the user attributes required by the queue configuration matching the `QueueName`. A good value for `GiveUpAfterSeconds` time is 120 seconds, to prevent users from giving up on their own.

```csharp
PlayFabMultiplayerAPI.CreateMatchmakingTicket(
    new CreateMatchmakingTicketRequest
    {
        // The ticket creator specifies their own player attributes.
        Creator = new MatchmakingPlayer
        {
            Entity = new EntityKey
            {
                Id = "<Entity ID goes here>",
                Type = "<Entity type goes here>",
            },

            // Here we specify the creator's attributes.
            Attributes = new MatchmakingPlayerAttributes
            {
                DataObject = new
                {
                    Skill = 24.4
                },
            },
        },

        // Cancel matchmaking if a match is not found after 600 seconds.
        GiveUpAfterSeconds = 120,

        // The name of the queue to submit the ticket into.
        QueueName = "myqueue",
    },

    // Callbacks for handling success and error.
    this.OnMatchmakingTicketCreated,
    this.OnMatchmakingError);
```

### Check the status of the matchmaking ticket

You must poll the service by `TicketId` to access the `Status` of the ticket in matchmaking. In order to do so, have your title call [GetMatchmakingTicket](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.matchmaking.getmatchmakingticket). We recommend polling for the ticket status every 15 seconds. When the status of the ticket changes to `Matched`, your client can stop polling the ticket. From that point on, the ticket will include the `MatchId`.

```csharp
PlayFabMultiplayerAPI.GetMatchmakingTicket(
    new GetMatchmakingTicketRequest
    {
        TicketId = "<ticket ID goes here>",
        QueueName = "myqueue",
    },
    this.OnGetMatchmakingTicket,
    this.OnMatchmakingError);
```

### Get the Match

From your client, call [GetMatch](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.matchmaking.getmatch) with the `MatchId` provided in the response from [GetMatchmakingTicket](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.matchmaking.getmatchmakingticket). This match contains the list of users who are matched together.  

```csharp
PlayFabMultiplayerAPI.GetMatch(
    new GetMatchRequest
    {
        MatchId = "<match ID goes here>",
        QueueName = "myqueue",
    },
    this.OnGetMatch,
    this.OnMatchmakingError);
```

### Cancelling a matchmaking ticket

If for some reason your client wants to cancel the matchmaking process prior to `GiveUpAfterSeconds` being reached, call [CancelMatchmakingTicket](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.matchmaking.cancelmatchmakingticket) with the `TicketId`. If a match hasnâ€™t already been found, the ticket is taken out of the matchmaking process and its status changes to `Canceled`.  

```csharp
PlayFabMultiplayerAPI.CancelMatchmakingTicket(
    new CancelMatchmakingTicketRequest
    {
        QueueName = "myqueue",
        TicketId = "<ticket ID goes here>",
    },
    this.OnTicketCanceled,
    this.OnMatchmakingError);
```

## Multiple User Ticket Matchmaking

If your game allows groups of players to go into a matchmaking queue together, there are a few more things that need to be done to enter matchmaking. We advise that your title assigns a group leader (the creator) to avoid making uncessesary calls. The leader creates the ticket, but all members of the group must consent to join it.

### Create a matchmaking ticket

The group must elect a ticket creator in your title. The creator creates a matchmaking ticket using [CreateMatchmakingTicket](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.matchmaking.creatematchmakingticket), which returns a `TicketId` upon success. The ticket creation requires you to specify the `Creator` (the user's identity and attributes), `GiveUpAfterSeconds` (the time in seconds before the service gives up on matching the ticket), `MembersToMatchWith` (the identities of the other group members) and the `QueueName` for which you are matchmaking into. The `Creator` field must contain the user attributes required by the queue configuration matching the `QueueName`. A good value for `GiveUpAfterSeconds` time is 120 seconds, to prevent users from giving up on their own.

### Group Members join the match ticket

Once the match ticket has been created, the other members of the group have to join it to move along the matchmaking process. At this time, the ticket is in the `WaitingForPlayers` status. It will not begin matching with other tickets until all `MembersToMatchWith` have joined the ticket. To have members join, the `Creator` must share the `TicketId` to the other members through your title. Each member then calls [JoinMatchmakingTicket](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.matchmaking.joinmatchmakingticket), providing their own required attributes. Once all members have joined the ticket, the ticket status becomes `WaitingForMatch`.  

```csharp
PlayFabMultiplayerAPI.JoinMatchmakingTicket(
    new JoinMatchmakingTicketRequest
    {
        TicketId = "<ticket ID>",
        QueueName = "myqueue",
        Member = new MatchmakingPlayer
        {
            Entity = new EntityKey
            {
                Id = "<Entity ID goes here>",
                Type = "<Entity type goes here>",
            },
            Attributes = new MatchmakingPlayerAttributes
            {
                DataObject = new
                {
                    Skill = 19.3
                },
            },
        }
    },
    this.OnJoinMatchmakingTicket,
    this.OnMatchmakingError);
```

The rest of the flow is the same as that of [single user ticket matchmaking](#Single-User-Ticket-Matchmaking)

## Conclusion

Using this quickstart, you should now have a successful matchmaking flow in your game. In addition, you should consider the following:

* how your title handles group formation;
* what your title displays while users are waiting for a match;
* how to handle failures and retries.

### Known Issues and Limitations

In Private Preview, polling of tickets is required to obtain the the match status and match Id. In the near future, we will have a push mechanism for the clients to be updated on state changes.

The multi-user ticket flow will also be improved by the push mechanism, and more queue rules will be made available to handle group ticket requirements. Follow the [PlayFab blog](https://blog.playfab.com/blog) for future updates on improvements to matchmaking.
