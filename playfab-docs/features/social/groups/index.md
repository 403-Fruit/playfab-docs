# Groups, Guilds and Clans

The entity type of Group can be utilized by your game to create guild and clan interactions within your game. This entity type offers the ability to create different roles for members, the ability to invite members into the group and manage group membership.

The Group that you create can utilize all of the base [Entity programming model](../../data/entities/index.md) capabilities. For example it can use [Objects](../../data/playerdata/entity-objects.md) and [Files](../../data/playerdata/entity-files.md) to store data that is specific to the Group.

To build your Guild or Clan system in your game, you will want to utilize Group functionality and create a customized experience within your game.
